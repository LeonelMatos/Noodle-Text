# NoodleText: The Documentation

## Noodle

\b NoodleText is a lightweight, simple text editor for Linux. Similar to one of the best in the game: Nano, but with a
personal touch for a casual day-to-day work. Using as a base the [SnapToken's kilo tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/).

## Motivation

I really love the Nano editor, simple and straightforward, no need for a complex program full of binds to memorize and is difficult
to exit, that's why I want to make something similar and as easy and light. I want to take this as an opportunity to learn how to make a text editor.
