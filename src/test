 The path of the righteous man is beset of all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

 Blessed is he who, in the name of the charity and goodwill, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

 for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance

 and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

 And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.
